# Multiclass Text Classification (Articles)

This project aims to use deep learning models to automatically categorize articles based on their topics. It aims to predict whether an article belongs to one of five categories: sport, business, politics, tech, or entertainment. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify articles and help automate the process of organizing and tagging content.

# Results

## LSTM Model Architecture

The architecture consists of two LSTM layers with 64 units each, followed by a dropout layer to help prevent overfitting. The output of the second LSTM layer is then fed into a dense layer with a softmax activation function that produces 5 output values. The embedding layer at the beginning of the model converts the tokenized words into dense vectors of fixed size.

Here is a summary of the model architecture:

## Tensorboard Result

The two plots below show the training progress of the LSTM model using TensorBoard.

The first plot shows the epoch loss for both the training and validation datasets. The loss is calculated as the difference between the predicted and actual values for each time step, and the lower the loss, the better the model performs.

The second plot shows the epoch accuracy for both the training and validation datasets. Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model, and it measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model. The higher the accuracy, the better the model performs.

## Training Process

The two plots below are the same as before exept it uses the matplotlib library.
