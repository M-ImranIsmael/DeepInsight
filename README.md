# Deep Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects covering various problems and techniques. Each project is grouped into one of the following categories:

## Classification Problems

1. [Cardiovascular Prediction](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/cardiovascular_prediction):

   This project uses deep learning algorithms to predict whether a person is suffering from a cardiovascular disease based on various medical factors. The problem is framed as a binary classification problem, with the goal of accurately classifying patients as either having or not having the disease.

2. [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/customer_segmentation_prediction):

   This project involves grouping customers into distinct categories based on their behavior and attributes. The problem is framed as a multi-class classification problem, with the goal of accurately assigning customers to different segments.

3. [Drybean Prediction](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/drybean_prediction):

   This project aims to predict the yield of drybeans based on various environmental factors and agronomic practices. The problem is framed as a multi-class classification problem, with the goal of accurately classifying the yield of drybeans into different categories.

4. [News Classification](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/news_classification) (Political News/World News) (Time-Series Data):

   This project involves classifying news articles into either political news or world news categories. The problem is framed as a multi-class classification problem, with the goal of accurately assigning news articles to the correct category. Additionally, the data collected is a time-series data, making it a time-series classification problem.

5. [Sentiment Prediction](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/sentiment_prediction) (Positive/Negative Reviews) (Time-Series Data):

   This project involves analyzing customer reviews and classifying them as either positive or negative. The problem is framed as a binary classification problem, with the goal of accurately classifying reviews as either positive or negative. Additionally, the data collected is a time-series data, making it a time-series classification problem.

## Regression Problems

1. [Auto Price Prediction](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/autopart_price_prediction):

   This project involves predicting the price of a used car based on various attributes and features. The problem is framed as a regression problem, with the goal of accurately predicting the price of a used car.

2. [Google Stock Prediction](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/google_stock_prediction) (Time-Series Data):

   This project involves predicting the stock price of Google based on historical data. The problem is framed as a regression problem, with the goal of accurately predicting the stock price of Google. Additionally, the data collected is a time-series data, making it a time-series regression problem.

3. [Medical Insurance Prediction](https://github.com/M-ImranIsmael/Deep_Learning_Applications/tree/master/medical_insurance_prediction):

   This project involves predicting the cost of medical insurance based on various demographic and health factors. The problem is framed as a regression problem, with the goal of accurately predicting the cost of medical insurance.

Each project folder contains all the necessary files, including scripts for training and testing, data files, and any saved models or intermediate outputs.
